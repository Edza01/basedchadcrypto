  I make $40 / mo. from AdSense, $100 / mo. from Affiliates, and $300 / mo. from advertisers. That's $440 / mo. that I don't really have to work to achieve. ($5280 / yr


  So, I first study the competitor (successful campaigns), create content or ad like them, share them on Facebook, and then promote them. The $50 which I spend on them give me better results than $500 without this strategy. My targeted audience on the Facebook automatically starts to share, like and visit my website.
