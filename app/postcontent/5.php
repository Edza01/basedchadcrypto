<h1>EU Prohibits Cross-Border Payments from Russian Crypto Accounts</h1>
<br>


<p>The European Union recently introduced a series of sanctions against Russia due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. One aspect of these sanctions is a prohibition on cross-border cryptocurrency transactions between Russia and EU member states. This ban applies to all cryptocurrency wallets, accounts, and custody services, regardless of the amount of cryptocurrency held in them.</p>
<br>
<h2>A pointless and unenforceable ban.</h2>
<br>

<p> The person or group responsible for crafting these sanctions may be aware that it is difficult to verify the ownership of a large number of cryptocurrency wallets, and that individuals with known wallets may be able to create additional, unidentifiable wallets. As a result, the ban on cross-border cryptocurrency transactions between Russia and EU member states may be difficult to enforce. It is unclear how effective this measure will be in achieving its intended goals.</p>
<p>This ban may have negative consequences for individuals who are not familiar with the technology or the ways in which it is used.</p>

<p>It is a tragedy that many Russian citizens are innocent of the actions of their government, but they still suffer the consequences. It is truly unfortunate</p>
