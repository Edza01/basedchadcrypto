<h1>What Is a Crypto ATM?</h1>


<p>Crypto automated teller machines (ATMs) are stand-alone electronic kiosks that allow users
     to buy and sell cryptocurrency in exchange for cash or with a debit card. All crypto
      ATMs sell Bitcoin, while some also offer other cryptocurrencies. Not all crypto ATMs 
      allow the sale of crypto, as some are limited to purchases only.
</p>
<p>Crypto ATMs do not connect to your bank account like a traditional ATM; rather, 
    they connect with a user&rsquo;s digital wallet to process the transaction and send crypto 
    to the customer. There are tens of thousands of crypto ATMs around the world, with a majority of them located in the United States.<br>
