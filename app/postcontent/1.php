<h1>Regulating cryptocurrency: next steps for the industry.</h1>


<p>
    Regulatory clarity is a topic that is often discussed within regulatory governance and policy circles. 
    It involves the clear and consistent definition of regulations, which helps all parties involved 
    to understand the rules and expectations that apply to them. This blog presents a plan for achieving 
    regulatory clarity in the crypto space, focusing on central actors and exchanges, while also preserving 
    the decentralized innovations that could have significant positive impacts on society. 
    The aim is to create a level playing field and support an environment in which innovation can flourish.
