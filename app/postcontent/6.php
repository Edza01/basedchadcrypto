<h1>Google Partners with Crypto to Accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin</h1>
<br>

<p>Google is collaborating with Coinbase Commerce to enable a select group of its customers to pay for cloud services using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrency assets.</p>

<p>Google has partnered with Coinbase to accept cryptocurrency payments for its cloud services from select customers. The collaboration with Coinbase Commerce was announced at Google's Cloud Next event and is expected to drive the migration of data-related apps from Amazon Web Services' cloud to Google's cloud.</p>

<p>It is unclear if Google will use Coinbase Commerce or PayPal's new crypto-integrated business service to process cryptocurrency payments, though Coinbase is currently the only option available to Google.</p>

<p>There is evidence of Google's interest in cryptocurrency and Web3.0. Alphabet, Google's parent company, has invested $1.5 billion in various blockchain companies, such as Dapper Labs and Alchemy. This suggests that Google is exploring the potential uses and applications of these technologies.</p>

<p>Tech giants are showing a growing curiosity in blockchain and Web3.0. In order to understand the potential of the metaverse, Facebook rebranded as Meta and launched an NFT feature. Microsoft also invested $20 million in a decentralized data warehouse to aid the development of Web3.0. As these innovative technologies become more common, it is likely that more companies will join the trend.</p>
