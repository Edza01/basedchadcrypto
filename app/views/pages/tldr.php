                <p class="faq-content">Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is not a private or anonymous cryptocurrency..</p>
                <p>While it is possible to use Bitcoin anonymously, the transaction data on the Bitcoin network is publicly available and can potentially be traced back to specific individuals or entities. For those seeking privacy and anonymity in their cryptocurrency transactions, there are other options available such as Monero or Zcash that offer stronger privacy features.</p>

                <summary title="What can I expect at my first consultation?">Is gold better than crypto?</summary>
                <p class="faq-content">Digital nature makes crypto easy to store and move, and crypto is more convenient and cost-effective to store and transport than physical assets like gold, which can be expensive and inconvenient to ship and store due to their weight and size. Additionally, the decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology make them resistant to censorship and fraud.</p>

                <p class="faq-content">Trezor and Ledger are both considered to be secure wallet options for storing cryptocurrency. Both Trezor and Ledger offer hardware wallets, which are physical devices that store your cryptocurrency offline in a secure environment. This makes them more secure than software wallets, which are stored on a computer or mobile device and are potentially vulnerable to hacking.</p>

                <summary title="Do I need a referral?">What is the best crypto?</summary>
                <p>Monero</p>
                <p class="faq-content">Monero is a cryptocurrency that is designed to prioritize privacy. One of the ways it does this is by obscuring the details of a transaction. When a Monero transaction is made, the sender is hidden within a small, random group of users. The recipient is protected by the use of stealth addresses, which are unique, one-time addresses that are created for each transaction. The amount of the transaction is also hidden. These measures help to ensure that the transaction remains private and that no one is able to learn the same information about the transaction as they would be able to with a more transparent cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Monero uses advanced mathematical techniques to ensure that the integrity of the transaction is maintained and that no fraudulent activity can occur.</p>

                <summary title="Is the cost of the appointment covered by private health insurance?">Is cryptocurrency used by criminals?</summary>
                <p class="faq-content">Cryptocurrency has sometimes been associated with illicit activity, as it can offer a level of anonymity that is not available with traditional financial systems. However, it is important to note that traditional financial systems, such as bank accounts and credit cards, are also sometimes used for illegal purposes. In fact, any financial system, whether it is digital or traditional, can potentially be exploited for illegal activity. It is important to note that the vast majority of cryptocurrency transactions are completely legitimate, and that the technology has the potential to offer many benefits, including increased efficiency and reduced costs.</p>

                <summary title="What are the parking and public transport options?">Should you share your private keys?</summary>
                <p class="faq-content">It is generally not recommended to share your private keys with anyone. Private keys are a crucial part of cryptocurrency security, as they are used to access and control your cryptocurrency assets. If you share your private keys with someone else, you are giving them access to your assets and potentially allowing them to make transactions on your behalf. This could result in the loss or theft of your cryptocurrency.</p>

                <summary title="What are the parking and public transport options?">What is the blockchain?</summary>
                <p class="faq-content">The blockchain is a decentralized, secure and transparent network that enables fast peer-to-peer transactions of digital values, such as currency and data. Its main purpose is to provide a trusted platform for the exchange of these digital assets.</p>
