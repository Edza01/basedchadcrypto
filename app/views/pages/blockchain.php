<h2>What is the blockchain?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that consists of a growing chain of blocks, or records, that hold information about transactions that have occurred online. Each block contains data encoded in a chronological manner, and these blocks are linked together in a way that makes it difficult to alter the data contained within them. The information stored in a blockchain is decentralized, meaning it is not stored in a single location, but rather is distributed across a network of computers. This makes it secure and resistant to tampering. Blockchain technology is used in a variety of applications, including the creation and transfer of cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and secure record-keeping.

<h2>What can be stored on blockchain?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    The blockchain is a distributed database that allows for the storage of digital records, also known as blocks. These blocks can contain a variety of information, including financial transactions, contracts, identities, and other forms of data. Essentially, any type of information that can be represented in digital form can potentially be stored on the blockchain.
</p>
    
<p>
    One of the key characteristics of the blockchain is that it is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by any single entity or organization. Instead, it is maintained by a network of participating computers, also known as nodes, that validate and record transactions on the blockchain. This decentralized nature of the blockchain allows for the storage of information in a transparent and secure manner, as the data is replicated across the network and can only be modified with the consensus of the participating nodes.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to storing various types of data, the blockchain can also be used to support smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These contracts can be used to automate a variety of processes and transactions, including financial transactions, supply chain management, and more.
