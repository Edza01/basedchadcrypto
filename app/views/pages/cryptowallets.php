    <h2>Crypto exchanges</h2>
    <br>
    <p>If you have crypto on exchanges, you don't own that money. You are paying company to hold your crypto, it's not yours. </p>
    <br>
    <li>Governments may have the authority to freeze or seize assets belonging to exchanges that operate within their jurisdiction.</li>
    <li>You may be at risk of tax theft, asset forfeiture theft, and civil theft.</li>
    <li>You may be at risk of exit theft.</li>
    <li>You make job for black hat hackers easy</li>

        Cryptocurrency security is a top concern for many investors, especially when it comes to protecting their digital 
        assets through the use of a crypto wallet. But with so many options available, it can be tough to determine which 
        wallets offer the highest level of security. In this article, we'll provide an overview of some of the most secure 
        crypto wallets currently on the market, as well as offer tips for selecting the safest option for your needs. 
        Remember, the ultimate security of your crypto wallet depends on how you manage it, so be sure to consider 
        all the factors that go into keeping your assets safe.

        Storing crypto on exchanges, banks, or web wallets can be risky and can contribute to the centralization of the crypto 
        ecosystem. This can lead to increased security vulnerabilities and reduced decentralization of the network. Instead, 
        it is generally considered more secure to store your crypto in a personal wallet that you control, such as a hardware wallet.
        This allows you to maintain control over your private keys, which are necessary to access 
        and use your crypto. By keeping your crypto in a personal wallet, you can help ensure the security of your 
        assets and contribute to the overall security and decentralization of the crypto network.

        When you download a cryptocurrency wallet, you may be prompted to get your seed keys. 
        These keys are displayed on the screen for you to read. However, you should be aware that your phone may have been 
        exposed to malicious sites or apps, which could have infected your device with malware. Many people's devices 
        are infected with malware, and someone may be able to use a key logger to watch your activity through the 
        infected software. Therefore, it's important to be cautious when downloading mainstream wallets, as your screen may 
        be captured as soon as you download or run the wallet.

    <h2>On a cryptocurrency exchange, you don't have control over your own digital assets.</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Organizations such as Coinbase and Visa have implemented measures to block Russian citizens from accessing their services.</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Message from Coinbase:</p>
    <b>„Important: Action required by May 31, 2022 to avoid losing access to your Coinbase account. To comply with EU sanctions that prohibit Coinbase from providing crypto services to certain Russian customers, Coinbase will soon restrict your ability to access your account. Before May 31, 2022, you need to withdraw all funds from your account or provide us with specific documents to show you are not covered by these sanctions. After that date you risk your funds being frozen. Additional funds sent to your Coinbase account during this time period may also be frozen.</b>

        The only current way to secure your crypto is to store it in a hardware wallet, I personally use both Trezor and Ledger
        I suggest that you get ones without Bluetooth because the most time-consuming and difficult aspect of hacking a device
        is often the information-gathering and planning stages. By reducing the attack surface device has, 
        you make it more difficult for attackers to gain access.
    </p>

    <p>
        I use Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets because they provide an extra layer of security for my cryptocurrency. 
        When you first create a wallet on a hardware device, it generates a seed key, which is a list of 
        random words that are displayed on the device's screen. This ensures that no hacker can access the key, 
        as it is not stored on your smartphone or computer. It's important to write down the seed key and 
        store it in a secure, location, possibly in multiple pieces, to ensure the safety 
        of your crypto assets. Using a hardware wallet is a smart way to store cryptocurrency. Quite opposite of crypto exchanges.
